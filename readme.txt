These are my assignments for the Coursera HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers Course by Johns Hopkins University. I have done all these assignments by myself, according to the instructions, without the ability to copy the actual code (with the exception of JavaScript assignments where we were provided some code to fix).
